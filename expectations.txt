I expect myself to be a more efficient and creative programmer for the web after
finishing CMSC 100 :DD I really want to be able to design, create, and manage
complete and industry-standard web pages and web applications, so I have high
expectations for this course :>


I agree, I also expect to be more efficient and creative at web designing after finishing this course since I don't have much experience/background in web development aside from being taught a little bit about it in CMSC 12.
